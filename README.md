# About

- A point-of-sale terminal application with a flutter frontend and mongodb backend.
- User accounts are secured with bcrypt encrypted passwords and JSON web token API access control.
- Realtime updates accomplished through a combination of stateful components that pass data back and forth throughout the app, and Socket.io websocket events to force update when necessary.
- REST API requests made through a Node.js server built with Express.js to Mongodb, accessed on the frontend through a API class to standardize the input and output.
